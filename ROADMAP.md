# Ninolex-GH Roadmap

## Vision

Ninolex-GH aims to be the canonical, open pronunciation dictionary for Ghanaian English and Ghanaian proper nouns – optimised for TTS engines, LLMs, and education products.

The long-term goal is to provide high-quality, machine-readable pronunciations for:

- Ghanaian names (Akan, Ewe, Ga, etc.)
- Towns, regions, constituencies and localities
- Secondary schools, universities and institutions
- Public figures, MPs, judges, footballers and cultural icons
- Foods, slang, and exam-related terms

---

## Current status (v0.1.x)

- Core exam terms (WASSCE, BECE, etc.)
- Selected foods and slang (waakye, dumsor, etc.)
- Regions and key towns
- Seed set of constituencies
- Seed set of football clubs
- Seed set of public figures and complex personal names
- Unified dictionary export (CSV + JSON)
- PLS export for TTS engines
