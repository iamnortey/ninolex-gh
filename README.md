# Ninolex-GH

**The open Ghanaian pronunciation dictionary for TTS, LLMs, and AI systems.**

---

## Overview

Ninolex-GH is an open, machine-readable pronunciation dictionary focused on **Ghanaian English and Ghanaian proper nouns**. It provides IPA-based phonetic transcriptions designed to help text-to-speech engines, language models, and educational applications pronounce Ghanaian names, places, foods, and institutions correctly.

### Use cases

- **Text-to-speech (TTS)** – Upload the PLS export to engines like ElevenLabs for accurate Ghanaian pronunciation
- **Large language models (LLMs)** – Use the JSON/CSV data to fine-tune or augment pronunciation-aware AI systems
- **Educational apps** – Build language learning tools with correct Ghanaian phonetics
- **Ghana-focused products** – Any application that needs to speak or process Ghanaian names properly

### Design principles

- **LLM-friendly** – Easy to consume from AI/ML pipelines
- **TTS-friendly** – Exportable to W3C PLS (`.pls`) for speech engines
- **Country-scalable** – Future variants like `Ninolex-NG`, `Ninolex-KE`, etc.

## Quick start – TTS / PLS (e.g. ElevenLabs)

1. Clone the repository and build the PLS export:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamnortey/ninolex-gh.git
cd ninolex-gh
python3 build/build_dictionary.py
python3 build/generate_pls.py
```

2. Upload `exports/ninolex_gh_core.pls` into your TTS engine as a pronunciation dictionary (e.g. in an ElevenLabs project).

3. Attach the dictionary to a Ghana-focused voice or project, then generate audio that includes Ghanaian names, places, foods, and institutions.

## Quick start – Developers (JSON / data)

You can consume Ninolex-GH as a data source in your own applications.

### Option 1 – Git submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/iamnortey/ninolex-gh.git external/ninolex-gh
```

Then in a **TypeScript / JavaScript** project:

```javascript
import dictionary from "./external/ninolex-gh/dist/dictionary/ninolex_gh_dictionary.json";

console.log(dictionary.length, "entries in Ninolex-GH");
console.log(dictionary[0].grapheme, "→", dictionary[0].phoneme);
```

In **Python**:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
path = root / "external" / "ninolex-gh" / "dist" / "dictionary" / "ninolex_gh_dictionary.json"

data = json.loads(path.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
print(len(data), "entries loaded from Ninolex-GH")
print(data[0]["grapheme"], "→", data[0]["phoneme"])
```

### Option 2 – Direct download

Download the JSON or CSV directly from the repository and integrate into your build process.

```

## Dictionary view vs domain sources

**Contributors** edit domain-specific CSV files under `data/` (core terms, places, people, sports, etc.).

**Consumers** use the unified dictionary and exports:

- CSV: `dist/dictionary/ninolex_gh_dictionary.csv`
- JSON: `dist/dictionary/ninolex_gh_dictionary.json`
- PLS: `exports/ninolex_gh_core.pls`

The unified dictionary is generated by merging all domain CSVs. This lets maintainers organise entries by category while giving downstream users a single, consistent data source.

### Rebuild commands

```bash
# Build unified dictionary (CSV)
python3 build/build_dictionary.py

# Generate JSON export
python3 build/generate_json.py

# Generate PLS export for TTS
python3 build/generate_pls.py
```
