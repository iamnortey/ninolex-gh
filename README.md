# Ninolex-GH

**The open Ghanaian pronunciation dictionary for TTS, LLMs, and AI systems.**

---

## Overview

Ninolex-GH is an open, machine-readable pronunciation dictionary focused on **Ghanaian English and Ghanaian proper nouns**. It provides IPA-based phonetic transcriptions designed to help text-to-speech engines, language models, and educational applications pronounce Ghanaian names, places, foods, and institutions correctly.

### Use cases

- **Text-to-speech (TTS)** – Upload the PLS export to engines like ElevenLabs for accurate Ghanaian pronunciation
- **Large language models (LLMs)** – Use the JSON/CSV data to fine-tune or augment pronunciation-aware AI systems
- **Educational apps** – Build language learning tools with correct Ghanaian phonetics
- **Ghana-focused products** – Any application that needs to speak or process Ghanaian names properly

### Design principles

- **LLM-friendly** – Easy to consume from AI/ML pipelines
- **TTS-friendly** – Exportable to W3C PLS (`.pls`) for speech engines
- **Country-scalable** – Future variants like `Ninolex-NG`, `Ninolex-KE`, etc.

## Quick start – TTS / PLS (e.g. ElevenLabs)

If you just want to improve Ghanaian pronunciations in a TTS engine:

1. Clone the repository and build the dictionary and PLS export:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamnortey/ninolex-gh.git
   cd ninolex-gh
   python3 build/build_dictionary.py
   python3 build/generate_pls.py
   ```

2. Upload `exports/ninolex_gh_core.pls` into your TTS engine as a pronunciation dictionary (for example, in an ElevenLabs project dictionary).

3. Attach the dictionary to your Ghana-focused voice or project and generate audio that includes Ghanaian names, places, foods and institutions.

## Quick start – Developers (JSON / data)

You can consume Ninolex-GH directly in your applications.

### Option 1 – Git submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/iamnortey/ninolex-gh.git external/ninolex-gh
```

Then in a **TypeScript / JavaScript** project:

```javascript
import dictionary from "./external/ninolex-gh/dist/dictionary/ninolex_gh_dictionary.json";

console.log(dictionary.length, "entries in Ninolex-GH");
console.log(dictionary[0].grapheme, "→", dictionary[0].phoneme);
```

In **Python**:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
path = root / "external" / "ninolex-gh" / "dist" / "dictionary" / "ninolex_gh_dictionary.json"

data = json.loads(path.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
print(len(data), "entries loaded from Ninolex-GH")
print(data[0]["grapheme"], "→", data[0]["phoneme"])
```

### Option 2 – Direct download

Download the JSON or CSV directly from the repository and integrate into your build process.

## Pronunciation key (IPA subset)

Ninolex-GH uses a practical subset of IPA for Ghanaian English. A few important symbols:

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `ɛ` | Open-mid front vowel | "bed" |
| `ɔ` | Open-mid back rounded vowel | Common in Ghanaian English |
| `ŋ` | Velar nasal | "sing" |
| `ʃ` | Voiceless postalveolar fricative | "ship" |
| `tʃ` | Voiceless postalveolar affricate | "church" |
| `dʒ` | Voiced postalveolar affricate | "judge" |
| `ˈ` | Primary stress marker | Before the stressed syllable |
| `.` | Syllable separator | For readability |

For a complete overview of symbols and conventions, see **[IPA_GUIDE.md](IPA_GUIDE.md)**.

## Dictionary view vs domain sources

**Contributors** edit domain-specific CSV files under `data/` (core terms, places, people, sports, education, etc.).

**Consumers** use the unified dictionary and exports.

The unified dictionary is available as:

- CSV: `dist/dictionary/ninolex_gh_dictionary.csv`
- JSON: `dist/dictionary/ninolex_gh_dictionary.json`
- PLS: `exports/ninolex_gh_core.pls`

The unified dictionary is generated by merging all domain CSVs. This lets maintainers organise entries by category while giving downstream users a single, consistent data source.

### Rebuild commands

```bash
# Build unified dictionary (CSV)
python3 build/build_dictionary.py

# Generate JSON export
python3 build/generate_json.py

# Generate PLS export for TTS
python3 build/generate_pls.py
```

## Quality checks

### IPA validation

To verify that all phonemes use only approved IPA characters:

```bash
python3 tests/validate_ipa.py
```

This script checks the unified dictionary and reports any entries with invalid characters. See [IPA_GUIDE.md](IPA_GUIDE.md) for the approved symbol set.
