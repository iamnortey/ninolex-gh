# Ninolex-GH Announcements

## LinkedIn post (long form)

Today I'm excited to share **Ninolex-GH v0.1.0** – an open, machine-readable pronunciation dictionary focused on **Ghanaian English and Ghanaian proper nouns**.

If you've ever tried to use TTS or AI tools with Ghanaian names, places, foods or institutions, you know how often the pronunciations are wrong. Ninolex-GH is my attempt to fix that in a structured, reusable way.

**What's in v0.1.0:**

- Core exam terms (WASSCE, BECE, etc.)
- Selected foods and slang (waakye, dumsor, etc.)
- Regions, key towns and a seed set of constituencies
- Seed set of football clubs
- Seed set of public figures and complex Ghanaian names
- Unified dictionary exports:
  - CSV and JSON for developers
  - W3C PLS for TTS engines like ElevenLabs

**Who is this for?**

- Developers building Ghana-focused apps and AI tools
- TTS users who want better pronunciations for Ghanaian content
- Educators and edtech builders who care about local correctness

Repo: https://github.com/iamnortey/ninolex-gh

It's early (v0.1.x), but the foundations are there: clear CSV structure, unified dictionary, build scripts, roadmap and contribution guidelines.

If you're interested in helping expand coverage (schools, constituencies, public figures, sports, etc.), I'd love contributions, feedback or even just ideas.
